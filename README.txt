Systems Analysis and Design

This course deals with the concepts, skills, methodologies, techniques, tools, and perspectives essential for systems analysts. I was able to gather data to analyze and specify the requirements of a system, design system components and environments, build general and detailed modes to assist in implementing a system, and design a database and UI for data input/output with controls to protect the system and its data. The whole project was developed over a series of 5 assignments. The basic idea is to design a system for the car sharing plan described in the Car Sharing Case Study.
